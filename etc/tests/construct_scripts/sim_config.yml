# chromosomes as determined by "chrs". "num" determines the number of random

# P5 - BC2* - PI2 - genome - rcODNbit - rcPI1 - BC2 - rcP7
# where rc refers to reverse complement. *Note: I2 sequence reads are platform
# specific. Four-color chemistry uses priming from P5 to capture the I2 read, 
# while Two-color chemistry uses a dedicated primer, similar to I1. This means 
# that depending on platform, I2 may be sense or anti-sense of the BC2 sequence.
